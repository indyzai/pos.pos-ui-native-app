 * re-tuning meant finding and editing all nine. Spread this instead, and
 * override individual props where a list genuinely differs (the project reorder
 * list renders a wider window because dragging scrolls past the visible rows;
 * the main task list clips subviews once it is long enough to pay for it).
 *
 * Changing a number here changes scroll behaviour on device — verify against
 * `docs/performance-budgets.md`, not a unit test: react-test-renderer has no
 * layout engine and will happily agree with any value.

 * shadow tree, and the next mount transaction unmounts a child at an index
 * that no longer exists and aborts the app. A list whose length crosses the
 * threshold (filter a long Done list down to a few rows) flips the prop and
 * hits exactly that: duplicated rows first, then a crash (#949, #969).
 * Android's ReactViewGroup re-attaches clipped children on the way back, so it
 * keeps the #766 scroll win.
