// Mobile's implementations of core's sync-encryption ports (#1056 phase 2).
//
//   SyncEncryptionKeyCachePort   -> expo-secure-store, via the existing secure-config
//                                   seam (platform keystore, AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK).
//   SyncEncryptionLocalStatePort -> AsyncStorage, the same device-local, never-synced
//                                   mechanism every other `@openpos_*` sync setting uses.
//
// Judgment call (deviates from the handoff's "one JSON blob with key + salt + params"):
// the secure blob holds ONLY the derived key. Salt and KDF params live solely in the
// AsyncStorage local state, because that is what core's transition orchestration writes
// (`localState.write({ discoveredSalt, discoveredParams })`) and it calls
// `keyCache.setKey()` BEFORE that write — so a key blob that also carried salt/params
// would have to guess them from the not-yet-updated local state and could silently
// persist a salt that does not match its key. One source of truth instead. Neither the
// salt nor the params are secret; both are in the clear in every artifact header.
//
// The local-state port is synchronous (core's shape) but AsyncStorage is not, so the
// port reads an in-memory cache that `loadSyncEncryptionLocalState()` hydrates and every
// write refreshes synchronously before the async persist. Callers must await the
// hydrate once per process before constructing ports.
