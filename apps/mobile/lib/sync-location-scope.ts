// Mobile's reader for core's `buildSyncLocationScope` — one stable string naming the sync
// backend + location this device is pointed at, read from the device's own config.
//
// Two consumers, and they must agree byte-for-byte:
//   - attachment presence reconciliation (#1119) — "has the backend configuration changed
//     under the stamp?"
//   - sync-encryption discovery states (#1138) — "was this lock set for the location we are
//     about to sync against?"
//
// The derivation itself lives in core so desktop TS uses the same one and Rust has a single
// shape to mirror. No secret is included: the string is written into plain AsyncStorage and
// into the device-local encryption sidecar.
