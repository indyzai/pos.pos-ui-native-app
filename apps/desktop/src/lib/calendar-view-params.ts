 * Prepares where a task dragged onto the sidebar's Calendar entry will land.
 *
 * Two things can go wrong, because the calendar reopens exactly where it was left
 * and the calendar cannot be navigated mid-drag — whatever is on screen when you
 * arrive is the only set of drop targets you can reach without letting go:
 *
 * - Schedule mode renders no drop targets at all, so a drag landing there simply
 *   cannot be completed. It is rescued to week, the only mode offering both a day
 *   and a time across a useful range. Day, week and month are each left alone;
 *   all three are legitimate drop surfaces for a different intent, and overriding
 *   a deliberate choice to fix one broken case is not worth it.
 * - The remembered date may be months away, where a drop would silently schedule
 *   far from now, so a drag always arrives on today. Ordinary navigation into the
 *   calendar is untouched — this runs only for a drag (#867).
