/**
 * "When did this device last prove, object by object, that the sync location still holds
 * every attachment it has a `cloudKey` for?" — the desktop half of the #1119 follow-up
 * (battery/traffic audit F3), ported from mobile's `attachment-sync-utils.ts`.
 *
 * An uploaded attachment's remote key is derived from its id and its bytes never change, so
 * a presence pass can only ever discover a server-side deletion behind the app's back. That
 * proof is worth having; it is not worth having every cycle. It now runs at most once per
 * day per sync location, plus every "don't know" case.
 *
 * ## Where the stamp lives, and why it is not in config.toml
 *
 * `localStorage`, next to `openpos-fast-sync-state-v1` in `sync-service-fast-sync.ts`. The
 * stamp is the same CLASS of fact as `FastSyncState` — a device-local, per-location, never
 * synced cache of what this device already proved about this remote — and the fresh-join
 * posture gate in `sync-service.ts` ORs the two together, so splitting one predicate's two
 * halves across two stores with different durability and different failure modes would be
 * the bug, not the safeguard.
 *
 * `config.toml` was the other candidate and is the wrong home: it is not a key-value store
 * but the sync CONFIGURATION, published as an atomic config/secrets pair with rollback
 * files, credential-state fingerprints and a crash journal behind one outer
 * read-modify-write lock — and the write would have to happen from inside a sync cycle,
 * which is exactly the code path already warned to use the direct native primitives rather
 * than nest that queue (see `getDropboxAccessTokenDirect`'s comment in `sync-service.ts`).
 * A daily cache stamp does not justify a Rust struct field, two Tauri commands and a
 * two-file fsync'd publication per write.
 *
 * Losing the stamp (a wiped profile, a portable move, a cleared WebView store) is fail-safe
 * in both directions: absent means "reconcile now" here, and "posture not established" to
 * the fresh-join gate — one extra HEAD pass, or one deferred prepare phase. Never the
 * other way.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * The scope string is `desktopSyncLocationScope(context)` in `sync-service.ts` — the SAME
 * value the encryption posture gate uses, computed once per cycle from the fully-resolved
 * cycle context and handed to both the reader (`hasAttachmentSyncWork`,
 * `hasCompletedAttachmentPresenceReconciliation`) and the writer (each backend, through
 * `AttachmentBackendDeps.presenceScope`). Mobile had to derive it twice and a
 * reader/writer derivation mismatch was a blocking review finding there; on desktop there
 * is one derivation and one value per cycle, so the two sides cannot disagree.
 *
 * A null/empty scope always means doubt: reconcile, and never stamp.
