/**
 * Runs the pomodoro clock and its completion alert app-wide.
 *
 * Both used to live in PomodoroPanel, which only mounts inside Agenda, so a
 * timer left running while the user worked in another view — or another
 * workspace, which is the whole point of the timer — never ticked to zero and
 * never alerted until Agenda was reopened. Reconciliation is timestamp-based,
 * so the clock still read correctly on return; only the sound, notification and
 * taskbar flash were missed (#528).
 *
 * Covers both phases: the break end alerts the same way the focus end does,
 * once the break is actually running (auto-start breaks, or Start pressed).
 *
 * Deliberately not gated on the Task reminders setting: that switch governs
 * date-driven reminders, it is off on every fresh install, and gating on it
 * meant the completion alert of a timer the user had just started silently
 * never fired (#528). The opt-out now lives with the feature, in Pomodoro
 * settings, and defaults on; the OS notification permission is the outer gate.
