// Which Task fields the MCP write surface (openpos_add_task/openpos_update_task) exposes as
// generic per-field input, derived from TASK_SYNC_FIELD_SCHEMA the same way
// apps/cloud/src/server-config.ts derives CLOUD_TASK_CREATION_ALLOWED_PROP_KEYS /
// CLOUD_TASK_PATCH_ALLOWED_PROP_KEYS — so a new synced field doesn't need a hand-edit here to
// reach MCP task creation/updates (see task-field-schemas.ts, which maps these names to Zod
// types).
//
// Package-style import, NOT the relative path task-sync-schema.ts's own sibling schema files
// use for scripts/check-synced-field-parity.ts's benefit: apps/mcp-server's tsconfig sets an
// emitting `rootDir: "src"`, so a relative import reaching outside it breaks `tsc`'s output
// layout (unlike apps/cloud, which never emits). Because of that, this file — unlike
// task-recurrence-fields.ts/shared-api-write-limits.ts — needs `bun install` to resolve and
// so is NOT safe for the parity script's zero-install "native-schema" CI job to import
// directly; task-field-schemas.test.ts is where the real derived field sets get cross-checked
// against TASK_SYNC_FIELD_SCHEMA (see that file for the independent recomputation). The
// exclusion list itself lives in the sibling task-write-field-exclusions.ts specifically so
// the parity script CAN import that one piece directly (see its own header comment).
