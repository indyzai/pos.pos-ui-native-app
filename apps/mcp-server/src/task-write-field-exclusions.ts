// Fields TASK_SYNC_FIELD_SCHEMA marks client-writable (cloudWrite 'create-patch' or 'patch')
// that the MCP write surface (task-write-fields.ts) deliberately does NOT expose as generic
// per-field tool input, each with a one-line reason — no silent gaps. (`attachments` is a
// dedicated input restricted to link-kind items — see link-attachments.ts — because file
// attachments need real file bytes this text interface cannot supply.)
//
// Split out from task-write-fields.ts (which also needs a `@openpos/core/task-sync-schema`
// import that requires `bun install` to resolve — safe for apps/mcp-server's own build, but
// not for scripts/check-synced-field-parity.ts's "native-schema" CI job, which runs with no
// node_modules at all) so that script can check this list for staleness on its own. The only
// import here is `import type`, which TypeScript erases entirely before execution — nothing
// for that job's zero-install environment to resolve.
