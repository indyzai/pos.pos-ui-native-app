# Release diagnostics ledger

Maintainer file, not user docs. Every stable or RC release adds one log line per change that field testers are asked to confirm, and removes the previous release's lines once their issues are confirmed or closed; unconfirmed lines are carried forward under the new version. Complicated fixes add their line in the fix commit (AGENTS.md "Diagnostic log rides complicated fixes"); simple UI fixes need none; the release pass (`publish-release`, `publish-rc-release`) adds the rest and does the trim.

Convention: a release-specific line carries `extra.releaseCheck = "<version>/<slug>"` so it can be found with `git grep -n releaseCheck` and trimmed by version. General diagnostics (the sync trail, `[sync-encryption]` events, `Mobile background sync started`/`finished`, activation proofs) never carry `releaseCheck` and are never trimmed.

## General (keep)

- Sync trail: `Sync start`, `Sync step`, `Sync read check found no changes`, `Sync diagnostic complete` (core `sync-run.ts`, both apps).
- `[sync-encryption]` state / remote-read / transition / error / activation (core + both apps).
- `Mobile background sync started` / `finished` / `run took longer than a minute` (`apps/mobile/lib/background-sync-task.ts`, #1001).
- `Mobile background sync registered` with interval (same file).
- Desktop `Sync backend selected; running the verification sync to activate it` (`useSyncSettings.ts`).

## v1.2.8 (add before tagging, trim in the release after)

Field names are checked against the log sanitizer by `packages/core/src/release-diagnostics-fields.test.ts`. Add every new field name to that test's list.

### Added

- **`v1.2.8/desktop-reminder-fired`** — `apps/desktop/src/lib/notification-service.tsx`, in `checkDueAndNotify` (`logReminderFired`), at all three fire sites: due-time repeats, task reminders and project review reminders. Message: `Desktop reminder fired`. Fields: `kind` (`due-repeat` | `task` | `project`), `entity` (`task` | `project`), `fireAt` (ISO occurrence time), `appState` (`focused` | `hidden`). No task title or body is ever logged. Tester's log: a user who sees no toast now has one line proving the scheduler fired, which separates a scheduling bug from a delivery bug (#1146).
- **`v1.2.8/file-activation-absent-blobs`** — `packages/core/src/sync-run.ts`, in `prepareRemoteWriteData` after `assertActivationAttachmentsProven`. Message: `Sync folder activation accepted attachments the folder does not hold yet`. Fields: `backend` (`file`), `deferred` (count), `ids` (first five attachment ids). Tester's log: a fresh desktop joining a Syncthing or mounted folder whose `attachments/` has not arrived now shows this line and the switch completes, where 1.2.7 logged `Sync failed … Candidate attachment proof failed for <id>` and left the previous sync settings active; the ids listed must later download on a normal cycle (in-app feedback, 2026-09-04).
- **`v1.2.8/desktop-notification-path`** — same file, in `sendNotification` (`logNotificationSent` / `logNotificationFailed`). Messages: `Desktop notification sent` and `Desktop notification send failed`. Fields: `path` (`flatpak` | `windows-packaged` | `plugin` | `web`) and, on the failure line, `error`. Tester's log: on a Microsoft Store install the line must read `path=windows-packaged`; a Store install that still falls through to `plugin` means the packaged command rejected, and the warning names the HRESULT it rejected with (#1146).

## v1.2.7 (add before tagging, trim in the release after)

Field names are checked against the log sanitizer by `packages/core/src/release-diagnostics-fields.test.ts`. `shouldRedactKey` matches by SUBSTRING, so `skippedPasses` (contains `pass`), `monkeyIndex` (contains `key`) and `userAgent` (contains `user`) are silently replaced with `[redacted]`. Add every new field name to that test's list.

### Added

- **`v1.2.7/sync-settings-activation-mobile`** — `apps/mobile/components/settings/use-sync-settings-transport-actions.ts` (in `handleSync`, guarded on an explicit `options.backend`, which only an activation passes). Message: `Sync backend selected; running the verification sync to activate it`. Fields: `backend`, `cloudProvider`. Tester's log: one line the moment a complete backend is chosen or saved, before any manual Sync tap. Desktop's equivalent is the existing line under **General**.
- **`v1.2.7/sync-status-published`** — `apps/mobile/lib/sync-service.ts`, in `finalizeSuccess`. Message: `Sync status published to the store`. Fields: `backend`, `statusPublished` (`wrote-local` or `unchanged`), `lastSyncAt`, `lastSyncStatus`. Tester's log: one line per successful cycle whose `lastSyncAt` advances, proving the Sync screen's "Last sync" is no longer frozen.
- **`v1.2.7/dropbox-signin-detached`** — `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/sync.rs` (Rust `log::info!`/`log::warn!`, target `sync`). Three phases: `phase=opened` after `open::that_detached` returns, `phase=callback-state-matched` when the real callback is accepted, `phase=callback-state-mismatch` when a stale tab replays an old state and is ignored. Tester's log: `opened` must appear immediately, not after the browser closes, and a completed connect ends in `callback-state-matched`.
- **`v1.2.7/incoming-link-redelivery`** — `apps/mobile/hooks/use-incoming-url.ts`. Message: `Incoming link delivered`. Fields: `scheme`, `host` (nothing further: a capture link carries the task title in its path and query), `delivery` (counter), `deduped`. Tester's log: pressing the same shortcut twice writes two lines with `deduped=false` and rising `delivery`; only an immediate launch-URL echo shows `deduped=true`.
- **`v1.2.7/fence-artifact`** — `apps/mobile/lib/sync-service.ts`, in `acquireWebdavRemoteMutationFence`. Message: `WebDAV sync fence artifact resolved`. Field: `artifact` (basename only). Tester's log: `artifact` must read `.openpos-sync-fence-v1.json` and must NEVER read `data.json` (#1132).
- **`v1.2.7/calendar-spanning-events`** — `apps/mobile/lib/external-calendar.ts`, at the end of `fetchSystemCalendarEvents`. Message: `Device calendar events loaded for the window`. Fields: `platform`, `total`, `multiDay`, `allDay`, `spanning`. Tester's log: on Android a month containing a multi-day event must report `spanning` greater than zero, which is exactly what the old containment query dropped.
- **`v1.2.7/cycle-unchanged-skip`** — `packages/core/src/sync-run.ts`, `logUnchangedCycleSkips`, called from both unchanged returns. Message: `Sync cycle changed nothing; passes skipped`. Fields: `backend`, `check` (`fast` or `read`), `skipped` (comma list). Tester's log: an idle device shows this after every `Sync fast check found no changes`, with `local-persist,store-refresh,attachments,remote-fence`. The field is `skipped`, NOT `skippedPasses`, which the sanitizer redacts.
- **`v1.2.7/daily-attachment-presence`** — `apps/desktop/src/lib/sync-service.ts`, in `hasAttachmentSyncWork`. Message: `Attachment presence re-verification checked`. Fields: `presenceDue`, `hasScope`. Tester's log: `presenceDue=false` on every cycle within a day of the last full pass, and `presenceDue=true` once a day or after the sync location changes.
- **`v1.2.7/android-attachment-link-fallback`** — `apps/mobile/lib/attachment-file-installer.ts`, after the native installer reports that Android refused the hard-link publication and used the exclusive-copy fallback. Message: `Android attachment generation published with exclusive-copy fallback`. Fields: `publication` (`exclusive-copy`). Tester's log: one line with `publication=exclusive-copy` proves the #1139 fallback succeeded instead of relying on the absence of the old `Could not publish attachment generation (EXDEV)` failure.

### Existing (do not add a second line)

- **`v1.2.7/fence-heartbeat-reclaim`** — `packages/core/src/sync-run.ts` (91887e4cf) already logs `Reclaimed an abandoned remote sync reservation`, naming the previous owner, its purpose and the lease time left; the busy path logs `Remote sync location is reserved; retrying after the lease lapses`.
- **`v1.2.7/webdav-plaintext-degrade`** — both apps already log `WebDAV read returned no strong ETag; using the plaintext compatibility write` with the `etag` the server actually sent (`apps/mobile/lib/sync-service.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/lib/sync-service.ts`, 6ca1b0375).
- **`v1.2.7/local-only-upload`** — `packages/core/src/sync-run.ts` already logs `Sync local reconcile` with `reconcile: 'aligned-skip'` (and `'idle-cache'` when the carried idle snapshot spared the full local read).
- **`v1.2.7/suspended-timeout-offline`** — the sync failure path logs `Sync failed` carrying the error text, which ends in `the request was interrupted while the app was suspended` (`SUSPENDED_REQUEST_MESSAGE`, core `http-utils.ts`).
- **`v1.2.7/background-sync-registration`** — added (67075324c). `apps/mobile/lib/background-sync-task.ts`, message `Mobile background sync registration checked` with `decision` (register | re-register | unchanged | unregister | deferred-until-foreground), `registered`, `storedInterval`, `interval`, `appState`. A tester's log must show `deferred-until-foreground` on a headless cold start and never a re-register there; `Mobile background sync registered` with its interval stays under General.

### Not added

- **`v1.2.7/daily-attachment-presence` (mobile half)** — the existing `Attachment sync skipped` / `Attachment pre-sync skipped` lines with `reason: 'no-pending-work'` prove the skip, but not whether the daily pass was due. A distinct line needs `apps/mobile/lib/attachment-sync-utils.ts`, and it would add an AsyncStorage read to the idle path this same release just optimized.
