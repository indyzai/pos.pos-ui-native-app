// mapping, and the enable/disable/passphrase-change transition orchestration that is
// shared between the WebDAV and Dropbox backends (both TS, both desktop+mobile).
//
// The File Sync backend does NOT use the generic transition functions here — its
// transition logic lives in Rust (apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/sync.rs) and mobile's own
// storage-file.ts, per the task handoff ("Rust necessarily duplicates the seam logic
// for the file backend — keep its surface minimal and mirror core naming"). Those
// implementations mirror the naming and semantics defined here (see their own files).
//
// Merge, revision, signature, and fingerprint logic are untouched by this module —
// encryption lives strictly at the storage seam, wrapping already-serialized bytes.
