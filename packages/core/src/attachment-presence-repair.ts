 * #1119 follow-up. When an attachment's remote blob is gone — deleted on the server, left
 * behind at a previous sync location, a lost upload — the only device that can repair it is
 * one that still holds the bytes locally. Clearing `cloudKey` is that repair: the normal
 * transfer lifecycle sees an attachment with no cloud copy and uploads it again.
 *
 * WebDAV has done this since #1119 with a per-attachment HEAD. This module is the same pass
 * for the backends that do their own thing (Dropbox's one folder listing, the self-hosted
 * cloud's per-blob probe) and for both apps, so the rule that makes it safe lives in ONE
 * place instead of four:
 *
 *   **Only a definitive "the remote does not have this" clears anything.** A network error,
 *   a 401, a 429, a 5xx, a timeout, a partial listing — every one of those is `null` here
 *   and changes nothing. Clearing on a "don't know" would re-upload the whole library every
 *   time a server hiccuped.

 * `pendingContentUpload` is excluded on purpose: that attachment already has a replacement
